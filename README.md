# Levi's Code Archive

Welcome to **Levi's Code Archive**.

This repository is my personal collection of scripts and coding projects. It serves as a secure backup and organization tool as I continue my coding journey.

## Purpose

The main goals of this archive are to provide secure online backups of my scripts and to create a portfolio for future employers. All scripts are available for public use, allowing others to study, modify, and build upon my work.

## Repository Features

- **Secure Backups**: Regularly updated copies of my projects.
- **Open Access**: All scripts are freely available for anyone to use.
- **Portfolio Resource**: Aimed at showcasing my work for potential employers.

## Contribution

I welcome contributions and feedback from anyone who wants to improve these scripts or use them as a foundation for their own projects. Letâ€™s create a collaborative environment that benefits everyone involved.

Thank you for visiting **Levi's Code Archive**. I hope you find the scripts useful and informative. Happy coding!
